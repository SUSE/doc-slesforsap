   <listitem>
    <para>
     Subscriptions for &sles4sap; include Extended Service Pack Overlap
     Support, which extends the overlap between the support periods of two
     consecutive service packs by three years. During this period, you
     receive support and all relevant maintenance updates under the terms of
     Long Term Service Pack Support (LTSS). This feature is only available
     with &sles4sap;.
    </para>
    <para>
     Extended Service Pack Overlap Support allows you to perform service pack
     migrations within three and a half (3½) years instead of only six
     months. This enables you to schedule migrations more easily and perform
     testing before a migration under less restrictive time constraints.
    </para>
    <para>
     At an additional cost, &suse; also offers Long Term Service Pack Support
     (LTSS). With LTSS, you receive support for a particular service pack
     after the ESPOS period ends. Since &sles4sap; includes one and a half
     (1½) years of general support and three years of ESPOS for each service
     pack, LTSS may only be offered for the last service pack. For more
     information about the life cycle of &suse; products, see:

     Subscriptions for &sles4sap; include &sls; Priority Support for &sap;
     Applications, which offers technical support for &sles4sap; directly from
     &sap;. The joint support infrastructure, provided by support engineers
     from &suse; Technical Support and &sap;, is based upon &sap; Resolve
     and offers seamless communication with both &sap; and
     &suse;. This <quote>One Face to the Customer</quote> support model
     reduces complexity and lowers the total cost of ownership.
