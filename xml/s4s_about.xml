  <title>Software repository setup</title>

  <para>
   Software included with operating systems based on &sle; is delivered as
   RPM packages, a form of installation package that can have dependencies on
   other packages. On a server or an installation medium, these packages are
   stored in software repositories (sometimes also called
   <quote>channels</quote>).
  </para>
  <remark>
   FIXME: "variant" is maybe not a good word... - sknorr, 2016-06-17
  </remark>
  <para>
   By default, computers running &productname; are set up to receive
   packages from multiple repositories. Of each of the standard repositories,
   there is a <quote>Pool</quote> variant that represents the state of the
   software when it was first shipped. There is also an <quote>Update</quote>
   variant that includes the newest maintenance updates for the software
   in the <quote>Pool</quote> variant.
  </para>

   If you registered your system during installation, your repository
   setup should include the following:

  <para>
   The tables in this section do not show <emphasis>Debuginfo</emphasis> and
   <emphasis>Source</emphasis> repositories, which are also set up but
   disabled by default. The <emphasis>Debuginfo</emphasis> repositories
   contain packages that can be used for debugging regular packages. The
   <emphasis>Source</emphasis> repositories contain source code for packages.
  </para>
  <para>
   Depending on your installation method, you may also see
   <literal>SLE-&product-ga;-SP&product-sp;-SAP-&product-ga;.&product-sp;-0</literal>
   which is the installation medium.
   It contains packages from all of the base software repositories listed
   above.
  </para>
  <para>
   Because there are own repositories for &productname;, &suse; can ship
   packages and patches that are specific to &productname;.
  </para>
  <note>
   <title>ESPOS updates shipped directly in update repositories</title>
   <para>
    Unlike in &productname; 11, updates related to Extended Service Pack
    Overlay Support (ESPOS) are shipped directly from the
    <literal>Update</literal> repositories. This means there is no separate
    ESPOS repository to set up.
   </para>
  </note>

  <para>
   In addition to the standard repositories, you can enable
   &slea; Modules and &slea; Extensions either during the installation or from
   the running system using &yast; or the command
   <command>SUSEConnect</command>.

     <para>
      Subscriptions for &sles4sap; include Extended Service Pack Overlap
      Support. It extends the overlap between the support periods of two
      consecutive service packs by three years. During this period, you
      receive support and all relevant maintenance updates under the terms of
      Long Term Service Pack Support (LTSS). This feature is only available
      with &sles4sap;.
     </para>
     <para>
      Extended Service Pack Overlap Support allows you to perform service pack
      migrations within three and a half (3½) years instead of only six
      months. This enables you to schedule migrations more easily and perform
      testing before a migration under less restrictive time constraints.
     </para>
     <para>
      At an additional cost, &suse; also offers Long Term Service Pack Support
      (LTSS). With LTSS, you receive support for a particular service pack
      after the ESPOS period ends. &sles4sap; includes one and a half
      (1½) years of general support and three years of ESPOS for each service
      pack. Therefore, LTSS may only be offered for the last service pack. For more
      information about the life cycle of &suse; products, see:

      Subscriptions for &sles4sap; include &sls;
      Priority Support for &sap; Applications. It offers technical support for
      &sles4sap; directly from &sap;. The joint support infrastructure is
      provided by support engineers from &suse; Technical Support and &sap;. It is
      based upon &sap; Resolve and offers seamless communication
      with both &sap; and &suse;. This <quote>One Face to the Customer</quote>
      support model reduces complexity and lowers the total cost of ownership.
