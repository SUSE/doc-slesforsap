  <title>Choosing between <command>sapconf</command> and
   <command>saptune</command></title>
  <para>
   On &s4s; you have the choice between <command>sapconf</command> and
   <command>saptune</command>. However, <command>saptune</command> is
   the more elaborate tool that offers more features.

  <title>Tuning Systems with &sapconf; 4</title>
  <para>
   The package <systemitem>sapconf</systemitem> is available for the &x86-64;
   and &ppc64le; architecture.
   This package contains the
   <systemitem>tuned</systemitem> profile <literal>sapconf</literal>.
   This single tuning profile sets recommended parameters for the following
   types of &sap; applications: &netweaver;, &hana; and &hana;-based applications.

  <para>
   &sapconf; consists of two primary parts:
  </para>
  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>
     A &systemd; service that ensures &tuned; and related services are

     configured &sapconf; tuning parameters using a script and configuration
     files.
    </para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <sect2 xml:id="sec-sapconf-4-enable">
   <title>Enabling and Disabling &sapconf; and Viewing Its Status</title>
   <para>
    After the installation of &sapconf;, &tuned; is enabled and the
    <literal>sapconf</literal> profile is activated. However, if
    another &tuned; profile is already enabled, &sapconf; will not enable its
    own &tuned; profile.
   </para>
   <para>
    To make sure &sapconf; applies all tuning parameters,
    reboot the machine after installation.
   </para>
   <para>
    You can inspect or change the status of &sapconf; as described in the
    following:
   </para>
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      To see the status of the service
      <systemitem class="daemon">sapconf</systemitem>:
     </para>
     <screen>&prompt.root;<command>systemctl status sapconf</command></screen>
     <para>
      The service should be displayed as <emphasis>active (exited)</emphasis>,
      as it is only responsible for starting &tuned; and will exit afterward.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      To start the service
      <systemitem class="daemon">sapconf</systemitem> and with it the service
      &tuned;:
     </para>
     <screen>&prompt.root;<command>systemctl start sapconf</command></screen>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Should <systemitem class="daemon">sapconf</systemitem> be disabled,

      &tuned;:
     </para>
     <screen>&prompt.root;<command>systemctl stop sapconf</command></screen>
     <para>
      This will terminate &tuned; as well, therefore the vast majority of
      optimizations will be disabled immediately. The only exceptions from that
      are options that require a system reboot to enable/disable.
     </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      To disable <systemitem class="daemon">sapconf</systemitem>, use:
     </para>
     <screen>&prompt.root;<command>systemctl disable sapconf</command></screen>
     <para>
      If you have not specifically enabled any of the services that &sapconf;
      depends on yourself, this will also disable most tuning parameters and
      all services used by &sapconf;.
     </para>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
   <para>
    Similarly, you can inspect and change the status of the underlying service
    &tuned;:

    <title>Additional Services that &sapconf; Relies On</title>
    <para>
     In addition to the &sapconf; service itself and the &tuned; service,
     &sapconf; also relies on the following two services:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       <systemitem class="daemon">sysstat</systemitem> which collects data on
       system activity.
      </para>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       <systemitem class="daemon">uuidd</systemitem> which generates time-based
       UUIDs that are guaranteed to be unique even in settings where many
       processor cores are involved. This is necessary for &sap; applications.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
   </tip>
  </sect2>
  <sect2 xml:id="sec-sapconf-4-configure">
   <title>Configuring &sapconf;</title>
   <para>
    In general, the default configuration of &sapconf; already uses the
    parameter values recommended by &sap;. However, if you have special
    needs, you can configure the tool to better suit those.
   </para>
   <para>
    The configuration of &sapconf; is split into two parts that can be configured
    in different ways:
   </para>
   <variablelist>
    <varlistentry>
     <term><filename>/usr/lib/tuned/sapconf/tuned.conf</filename></term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       This file contains basic parameters. It also calls the
       <filename>script.sh</filename> from the same directory.
      </para>
      <para>
       To configure parameters from this file, copy it to the custom profile
       directory of &tuned; under <filename>/etc/tuned</filename> first and
       then change values in it. If you change the file in place instead, you
       will lose the changes you make on the next update of the
       <package>sapconf</package> package.
      </para>
      <para>
       Configure the file as described in the following:
      </para>
      <procedure>
       <title></title>
       <step>
        <para>
         Create a new custom &tuned; profile directory and copy the file
         <filename>tuned.conf</filename>:
        </para>
<screen>&prompt.root;mkdir /etc/tuned/sapconf
&prompt.root;cp /usr/lib/tuned/sapconf/tuned.conf /etc/tuned/sapconf/</screen>
       </step>
       <step>
        <para>
         Within the newly copied <filename>tuned.conf</filename>, fix the
         reference to <filename>script.sh</filename> to use an absolute path
         that points to the script from the original profile:
        </para>
        <screen>script = /usr/lib/tuned/sapconf/script.sh</screen>
        <para>
         Do not instead copy <filename>script.sh</filename>, as that
         provokes update compatibility issues for &sapconf;.
        </para>
       </step>
       <step>
        <para>
         Edit the parameters in
         <filename>/etc/tuned/sapconf/tuned.conf</filename>.
        </para>
       </step>
      </procedure>
      <para>
       After each update to &sapconf;, make sure to compare the contents of
       the original and the custom <filename>tuned.conf</filename>.
      </para>
      <para>
       Log messages related to this file are written to
       <filename>/var/log/tuned/tuned.log</filename>.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
    <varlistentry>
     <term><filename>/etc/sysconfig/sapconf</filename></term>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       This file contains most parameters of &sapconf;. The parameters from
       this file are applied using the aforementioned script
       <filename>/usr/lib/tuned/sapconf/script.sh</filename>.
      </para>
      <para>
       This file can be edited directly. All parameters in this file are
       explained by means of comments and references to &sap; Notes which can
       be viewed at <link xlink:href="https://launchpad.support.sap.com/"/>.
      </para>
      <para>
       When &sapconf; is updated, all customized parameters from this file will
       be preserved as much as possible. However, sometimes parameters cannot
       be transferred cleanly to the new configuration file. Therefore, after
       updating it is advisable to check the difference between the previous
       custom configuration which during the update is moved to
       <filename>/etc/sysconfig/sapconf.rpmsave</filename>
       and the new version at <filename>/etc/sysconfig/sapconf</filename>.
      </para>
      <para>
       Log messages related to this file are written to
       <filename>/var/log/sapconf.log</filename>.
      </para>
     </listitem>
    </varlistentry>
   </variablelist>
   <para>
    When editing either of these files, you will find that some values are
    commented by means of a <literal>#</literal> character at the beginning of
    the line. This means that while the parameter is relevant for tuning, there
    is no suitable default for it.
   </para>
   <para>
    Conversely, you can add <literal>#</literal> characters to the beginning of
    the line to comment specific parameters. However, you should avoid this
    practice, as it can lead to &sapconf; not properly applying the profile.
   </para>
   <para>
    To apply edited configuration, restart &sapconf;:
   </para>
   <screen>&prompt.root;<command>systemctl restart sapconf</command></screen>
   <para>
    Confirming that a certain parameter value was applied correctly works
    differently for different parameters. Hence, the following serves as an
    example only:
   </para>
   <example xml:id="ex-sapconf-change-parameter">
    <title>Checking Parameters</title>
    <para>
     To confirm that the setting for <literal>TCP_SLOW_START</literal> was
     applied, do the following:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       View the log file of &sapconf; to see whether it applied the value.
       Within <filename>/var/log/sapconf.log</filename>, check for a line
       containing this text:
      </para>
      <screen>Change net.ipv4.tcp_slow_start_after_idle from 1 to 0</screen>
      <para>
       Alternatively, the parameter may have already been set correctly
       before &sapconf; was started. In this case, &sapconf; will not change
       its value:
      </para>
      <screen>Leaving net.ipv4.tcp_slow_start_after_idle unchanged at 1</screen>
     </listitem>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       The underlying option behind <literal>TCP_SLOW_START</literal> can be
       manually configured at
       <filename>/proc/sys/net.ipv4.tcp_slow_start_after_idle</filename>.
       To check its actual current value, use:
      </para>
      <screen>&prompt.root;<command>sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_slow_start_after_idle</command></screen>
     </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    When &sapconf; is updated, all customized parameters from this file will
    be preserved as much as possible. However, sometimes parameters cannot
    be transferred cleanly to the new configuration file. Therefore, after
    updating it is advisable to check the difference between the previous
    custom configuration which during the update is moved to
    <filename>/etc/sysconfig/sapconf.rpmsave</filename>
    and the new version at <filename>/etc/sysconfig/sapconf</filename>.
   </para>
   <para>
    Log messages related to this file are written to
    <filename>/var/log/sapconf.log</filename>.
   </para>
   <para>
    When editing either of these files, you will find that some values are
    commented by means of a <literal>#</literal> character at the beginning of
    the line. This means that while the parameter is relevant for tuning, there
    is no suitable default for it.
   </para>
   <para>
    Conversely, you can add <literal>#</literal> characters to the beginning of
    the line to comment specific parameters. However, you should avoid this
    practice, as it can lead to &sapconf; not properly applying the profile.
   </para>
   <para>
    To apply edited configuration, restart &sapconf;:
   </para>
   <screen>&prompt.root;<command>systemctl restart sapconf</command></screen>
   <para>
    Confirming that a certain parameter value was applied correctly works
    differently for different parameters. Hence, the following serves as an
    example only:
   </para>
   <example xml:id="ex-sapconf-change-parameter-5">
    <title>Checking Parameters</title>
    <para>
     To confirm that the setting for <literal>TCP_SLOW_START</literal> was
     applied, do the following:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
     <listitem>
      <para>
       View the log file of &sapconf; to see whether it applied the value.
       Within <filename>/var/log/sapconf.log</filename>, check for a line
       containing this text:
      </para>
      <screen>Change net.ipv4.tcp_slow_start_after_idle from 1 to 0</screen>
      <para>
       Alternatively, the parameter may have already been set correctly
       before &sapconf; was started. In this case, &sapconf; will not change
       its value:
      </para>
      <screen>Leaving net.ipv4.tcp_slow_start_after_idle unchanged at 1</screen>
     </listitem>

       The underlying option behind <literal>TCP_SLOW_START</literal> can be
       manually configured at

       To check its actual current value, use:
