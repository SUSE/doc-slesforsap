  <title>Simplified &hana; System Replication Setup</title>

  <para>
   &sles4sap; supports &hana; System Replication using components of &sleha;
   and two additional resource agents (RA). Additionally, &s4s; ships with
   a &yast; wizard that simplifies the cluster setup.

    Terms:
    + scale-up: adding more resources to an existing system
    + scale-out: adding complementary systems to your existing ones

    Replication is orthogonal to either of these: It is possible with either
    scale-up or scale-out scenarios. (It is just that SLES does not support
    scale-out at the moment.)

    Fixme/12 SP2: Are scale-out scenarios supported? FATE#318793

   <!--
    Feedback from Fabian Herschel regarding the word "failover":
    "[W]e should be careful about terms like "failover" or "takeover". Because
    in the SAP HANA ecosystem, the terms are all used twice but differently
    than we do. As normally only SAP HANA users will be interested in details
    about the RAs, I suggest to follow the SAP wording to avoid confusion."
    => Use "takeover".
   -->
   <para>
    This resource agent from SUSE supports scale-up scenarios by checking the
    &hana; database instances for whether a takeover needs to happen.
    Unlike with the pure &sap; solution, takeovers can be automated.
   </para>
   <para>
    It is configured as a master/slave resource: The master assumes
    responsibility for the &hana; databases running in primary mode,
    whereas the slave is responsible for instances
    that are operated in synchronous (secondary) status. In case of a takeover,
    the secondary (slave resource instance) can automatically be promoted to
    become the new primary (master resource instance).
   </para>

   <para>
    This resource agent supports system replication for the following in
    scale-up scenarios:
   </para>
   <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
     <formalpara>
      <title>Performance-Optimized Scenario</title>
      <para>
       Two servers (A and B) in the same &sleha; cluster, one primary (A)
       and one secondary (B). The &hana; instance from the primary server (A) is
       replicated synchronously to the secondary server (B).
      </para>
     </formalpara>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <formalpara>
      <title>Cost-Optimized Scenario</title>
      <para>
       The basic setup of A and B is the same as in the
       <emphasis>Performance-Optimized Scenario</emphasis>.
       However, the secondary server (B) is also used for non-productive
       purposes, such as for an additional &hana; database for development or
       QA. The production
       database is only kept on permanent memory, such as a hard disk.
       If a takeover needs to occur, the non-productive server will be stopped
       before the takeover is processed. The system resources for the
       productive database are then increased as quickly as possible via an
       &sap; hook call-out script.
      </para>
     </formalpara>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
     <formalpara>
      <title>Chain/Multi-Tier Scenario</title>
      <para>
       Three servers (A, B, and C), of which two are located in the
       same &sleha; cluster (A and B). The third server (C) is located
       externally. The &hana; system on the primary server (A) is replicated
       synchronously to the secondary server (B). The secondary server (B) is
       replicated asynchronously to the external server (C).
      </para>
     </formalpara>
     <para>
      If a takeover from A to B occurs, the connection between B and C remains
      untouched. However, B is not allowed to be the source for two servers
      (A and C), as this would be a <quote>star</quote> topology which
      is not supported with current &hana; versions (such as SPS11).
     </para>
     <para>
      Using &hana; commands, you can then manually decide what to do:
     </para>
     <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        The connection between B and C can be broken, so that B can
        connect to A.
       </para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
       <para>
        If replication to the external site (C) is more important than
        local system replication, the connection between B and C can be kept.
       </para>
      </listitem>
     </itemizedlist>
    </listitem>
   </itemizedlist>
   <para>
    For all of the scenarios, &sles4sap; supports both single-tenant and
    multi-tenant (MDC) &hana; databases. That is, you can use &hana; databases that
    serve multiple &sap; applications.
